# StudyHelper – Backend

**StudyHelper** is the backend part of a project designed to help students better understand Technology topics.  
It uses external APIs to generate explanations, quiz questions, and related articles.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Generates explanations using the **OpenAI API**
- Adds quiz questions from **QuizAPI.io** 
- Includes a related article from **NewsAPI**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user sends a topic, a difficulty level (`low`, `medium`, or `high`), and whether a quiz should be included.
2. The backend responds with:
   - A generated explanation
   - Quiz questions (if requested)
   - A short article summary

## 📥 Example Request (POST `/study-helper`)

```json
{
  "topic": "Java Streams",
  "level": "medium",
  "includeQuiz": true
}
